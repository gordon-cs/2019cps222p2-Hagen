# 2019cps222p2-Hagen

Writing code for this project was challenging, though also fun trying to piece things together. I felt like I definitely should have started earlier with this project, but it was really cool understanding more about how stacks are used and the different methods of push, pop, top, etc. 
I couldn't quite figure out how to do the throw exception errors because adding them just generated more errors.
